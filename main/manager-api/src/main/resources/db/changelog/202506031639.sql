1. The difference between Doubao ASR and Doubao (Streaming) ASR is: Doubao ASR is billed per request, while Doubao (Streaming) ASR is billed by duration
2. Generally, per-request billing is cheaper, but Doubao (Streaming) ASR uses large model technology and delivers better results
3. You need to create an application in the Volcengine console and obtain the appid and access_token
4. Supports Chinese speech recognition
5. Requires a network connection
6. Output files are saved in the tmp/ directory
Application steps:
1. Visit https://console.volcengine.com/speech/app
2. Create a new application
3. Obtain the appid and access_token
4. Fill them into the configuration file
